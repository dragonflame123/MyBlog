      <p class="text-muted">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

      <p class="text-muted">It is a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Hiring a tour guide will be better to understand the stories of such a historical place. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It is a historical site and famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago.</p>

      <p>I loved the movie a lot 
        As I am a great fan of marvel
        Avengers: Endgame', which marks the end of the Infinity Saga, is spellbinding and surely an enthralling experience.
        The last film of the 'Avengers' franchise is remarkable and doesn't disappoint.
        Watching all our favorite superheroes in one film is just surpassing.
        Marvel has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released 'Iron Man'.
        I'm so sure that all of their hard work and ambition has paid off.
        The directors, Anthony and Joe Russo have made sure that it delivers an unforgettable experience.
        Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have come up with a screenplay full of epic and unpredictable moments.
        The film has a great balance of humor, emotions, and action. The biggest strength of the film is the emotions.
        This is the most emotional superhero film I have ever seen. It's just perfect.
        The action sequences were jaw-dropping.
        The climactic battle left me amazed.
        It's just filled with memorable moments and cannot be described with words.
        The visuals are gorgeous and have a great impact on the film. The humor doesn't look exaggerated and manages to entertain throughout the film.
        The plot twists were very impressive and suspenseful. The film features many cameos of characters from the previous MCU films, which just gives a double dose of excitement.
        The background score gives me goosebumps, though I've listened to it several times. It was really clever to make changes to the characterization of the Hulk. I enjoyed that a lot.
        But the show-stealer is Robert Downey Jr, who plays the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man.
        The man who started it all proves yet again that there's no one else who can perfect his role.
         Do not miss his powerful moments in the final battle.</p>

        As a big fan of this film since childhood, I know that the 1994 version of this visually fantastic movie will never be beaten. Thus, the remake of this film did not reach that goal. However, it did bring some new perspectives for millions of eyes around the world. Jon Favreau, director of many films, including 2016's the Jungle Book, did an excellent job with this CGI remake of the Lion King.
I am proud to be one of several theater witnesses on opening day to watch this wonderfully made film. Although -- admittedly -- the animals don't have a flexible amount of facial expressions, the story, the music, the scenery, to me, is what was most important. I think Jon and the whole cast and crew did a wonderful job recreating a masterpiece, trying not to top it, but trying to expand it a little for the new generation of high film making technology. I did cry a few times, I laughed several times, but my mouth was in awe nearly the entire way through. One of the things that excited me for this movie was the major fact that the legendary James Earl Jones, the original Mufasa himself, decided to come back to play everyone's favorite king of the Pridelands. At age 88, he sounds as though he hardly aged! What a blessing.
Everyone else did a splendid job with their parts, creating emotions through their body language if not through their faces. The crew did beautifully with the realistic visual designs for both the scenes and the characters. The music had me moving so much as it was a near replica of the original soundtrack from 1994 -- only, it was more epic!
Thank you again, Jon, for collaborating with Disney and several other talented people, to help make this movie beautiful, moving, and intense, once again. I look forward to buying this on DVD once it releases!
